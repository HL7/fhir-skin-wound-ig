## Introduction

The Skin Wound Assessment Implementation Guide is based on [FHIR Version R4] and defines an initial set of  minimum conformance requirements for implementations. This work is being conducted under the [Electronic Health Records (EHR) Workgroup](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/EHR) and utilizes the [Podiatry Profile PSS](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CIC/Skin+and+Wound+PSS) work compiling clinical content as a test of concept. The test of concept is the next step in constructing a framework for building conformance-testable representations for accuracy and authenticity attributes, required for asserting data accuracy, records authenticity, and fitness for use for specified end-uses. (See Guidance tab). This work benefits substantially from ongoing cross-collaboration with the CIMI Workgroup.
